# Installation 

First, **allocate GPU** to install CUDA dependent libraries correctly. Installation Takes a few minutes (especially torch_scatter). The script will install a new virtual environment along with dependencies and modified repositories ScaLR and WaffleIron.

```
source install.sh
```

Activate environment with loading modules via:

```
source env.sh
```

# Visualization
open3d - Need to be installed differently to use previous visualizations from utils.py
